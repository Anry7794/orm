BC Breaks
=========

We evaluate here only BC breaks you will probably encounter. This major version consists also of other minor (quite internal) BC breaks, i.e. the probability you don't use these semi-public API is quite high.

- **Repository::getById()** does not accept IEntity anymore. If you have an entity, explicitly read its id. `->getById($entity->id)`.
